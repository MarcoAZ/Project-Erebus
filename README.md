# Project Erebus
#### A Text Adventure Game
You are a software developer at Ingen Systems that provides hardware and software to businesses, enterprises, and even foreign governments. The secrecy surrounding Project Erebus has given you a bad feeling. Your suspicions are proven correct when you are contacted by a mysterious group calling themselves HERMES, whose objective is to protect people's right to privacy. They explain the government funded project was a worm that could monitor any activity on a user's computer and report it back to the corporation. It spread by copying itself onto USB drives and through networks. With your access to the building and its servers, you are one of the few people capable of blowing the whistle. It's not enough to destroy the project. You'll need proof of what has happened.
Your objectives:

1. Find proof of the government agency's knowledge and intentions for the software.
2. Get samples of the data that's been collected
3. Upload the group's counter-measure to the corporate servers
4. Get the data out of the building!

It is ok to complete only some of these objectives but it would be best to have all the evidence.
